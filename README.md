Currently a work in progress, this repository collects the makings for our DIY Prosthetics Workshop (see, e.g., criticalmaking.com/ddimit/?p=491 )

When complete, it will contain:

1. A guide to critical making.
2. Prompts for discussion.
3. Parts lists, sample code, and fritzing circuit diagrams for basic components.
4. Guide for conveners, including some considerations for finding additional prompts.
